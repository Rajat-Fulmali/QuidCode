            <h1>The great wall of china</h1>
            <p>Great might be an understatement. One of the world’s largest building-construction projects, the
                Great Wall of China is widely thought to be about 5,500 miles (8,850 km) long; a disputed Chinese
                study, however, claims the length is 13,170 miles (21,200 km). Work began in the 7th century BCE and
                continued for two millennia. Although called a “wall,” the structure actually features two parallel
                walls for lengthy stretches. In addition, watchtowers and barracks dot the bulwark. One not-so-great
                thing about the wall, however, was its effectiveness. Although it was built to prevent invasions and
                raids, the wall largely failed to provide actual security. Instead, scholars have noted that it
                served more as “political propaganda.”</p>
            <p>The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of
                ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe.
                Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with selective stretches later joined together by
                Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive
                dynasties have built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The most well-known sections of the wall
                were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).</p>
            <p>Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties
                on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and
                emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of
                watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the
                fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.</p>
            <p>The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from Liaodong in
                the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River (Taohe) in the
                south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe. A comprehensive archaeological survey, using
                advanced technologies, has concluded that the walls built by the Ming dynasty measure 8,850 km (5,500 mi). This
                is made up of 6,259 km (3,889 mi) sections of actual wall, 359 km (223 mi) of trenches and 2,232 km (1,387 mi) of
                natural defensive barriers such as hills and rivers. Another archaeological survey found that the entire wall with all of
                its branches measures out to be 21,196 km (13,171 mi). Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is generally
                recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.</p>
            <p>In Chinese histories, the term "Long Wall(s)" appears in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian, where it
                referred both to the separate great walls built between and north of the Warring States and to
                the more unified construction of the First Emperor. The Chinese character 城, meaning city or fortress, is a
                phono-semantic compound of the "earth" radical 土 and phonetic 成, whose Old Chinese pronunciation has been
                reconstructed as *deŋ. It originally referred to the rampart which surrounded traditional Chinese cities and was
                used by extension for these walls around their respective states; today, however, it is much more often the Chinese
                word for "city".</p>
            <p>The longer Chinese name "Ten-Thousand Mile Long Wall" came from Sima Qian's description of it in the Records, though
                he did not name the walls as such. The AD 493 Book of Song quotes the
                frontier general Tan Daoji referring to "the long wall of 10,000 miles", closer to the modern name, but the name
                rarely
                features in pre-modern times otherwise. The traditional Chinese mile was an often irregular distance that was
                intended to show the length of a standard village and varied with terrain but was usually standardized at distances
                around a third of an English mile (540 m). Since China's metrication in 1930, it has been exactly equivalent to 500
                metres or 1,600 feet, which would make the wall's name describe a distance of 5,000 km (3,100 mi). However, this use
                of "ten-thousand" (wàn) is figurative in a similar manner to the Greek and English myriad and simply means
                "innumerable" or "immeasurable".</p>

            <h1>Chichén Itzá</h1>
            <p>Chichén Itzá is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, which flourished in the 9th and 10th centuries CE.
                Under the Mayan tribe Itzá—who were strongly influenced by the Toltecs—a number of important monuments and temples
                were built. Among the most notable is the stepped pyramid El Castillo (“The Castle”), which rises 79 feet (24
                meters) above the Main Plaza. A testament to the Mayans’ astronomical abilities, the structure features a total of
                365 steps, the number of days in the solar year. During the spring and autumnal equinoxes, the setting sun casts
                shadows on the pyramid that give the appearance of a serpent slithering down the north stairway; at the base is a
                stone snake head. Life there was not all work and science, however. Chichén Itzá is home to the largest tlachtli (a
                type of sporting field) in the Americas. On that field the residents played a ritual ball game popular throughout
                pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.</p>
            </p>Chichen Itza was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The
            archaeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico. Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the
            Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the
            early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles,
            reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The
            presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest
            from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result
            of cultural diffusion.</p>
            <p>Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or
                Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature.[2] The city may have had the most diverse population in the
                Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.</p>
            <p>The ruins of Chichen Itza are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexico's Instituto
                Nacional de Antropología e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History). The land under the monuments had been
                privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it was purchased by the state of Yucatán. Chichen Itza is one of the most
                visited archaeological sites in Mexico with over 2.6 million tourists in 2017</p>
            <p>The Maya name "Chichen Itza" means "At the mouth of the well of the Itza." This derives from chi', meaning "mouth" or
                "edge", and chʼen or chʼeʼen, meaning "well". Itzá is the name of an ethnic-lineage group that gained political and
                economic dominance of the northern peninsula. One possible translation for Itza is "enchanter (or enchantment) of
                the water," from its (itz), "sorcerer", and ha, "water".</p>
            <p>The name is spelled Chichén Itzá in Spanish, and the accents are sometimes maintained in other languages to show that
                both parts of the name are stressed on their final syllable. Other references prefer the Maya orthography, Chichʼen
                Itzaʼ (pronounced [tʃitʃʼen itsáʔ]). This form preserves the phonemic distinction between chʼ and ch, since the base
                word chʼeʼen (which, however, is not stressed in Maya) begins with a postalveolar ejective affricate consonant. The word
                "Itzaʼ" has a high tone on the "a" followed by a glottal stop (indicated by the apostrophe).</p>

            <h1>Petra</h1>
            <p>The ancient city of Petra, Jordan, is located in a remote valley, nestled among sandstone mountains and cliffs. It
                was purported to be one of the places where Moses struck a rock and water gushed forth. Later the Nabataeans, an
                Arab tribe, made it their capital, and during this time it flourished, becoming an important trade center,
                especially for spices. Noted carvers, the Nabataeans chiseled dwellings, temples, and tombs into the sandstone,
                which changed color with the shifting sun. In addition, they constructed a water system that allowed for lush
                gardens and farming. At its height, Petra reportedly had a population of 30,000. The city began to decline, however,
                as trade routes shifted. A major earthquake in 363 CE caused more difficulty, and after another tremor hit in 551,
                Petra was gradually abandoned. Although rediscovered in 1912, it was largely ignored by archaeologists until the
                late 20th century, and many questions remain about the city.</p>
            <p>Petra, originally known to its inhabitants in as Raqmu or Raqēmō is a historic and archaeological city in southern Jordan. Petra lies around
                Jabal Al-Madbah in a basin surrounded by mountains which form the eastern flank of the Arabah valley that runs from
                the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and the
                Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital city of their kingdom, as early as the 4th century
                BC. However, archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second
                century BC, by which time Petra had become their capital. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in
                Petra's proximity to the trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.</p>
            <p>The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra became the focus of their wealth. The
                Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts, unlike their enemies, and were able to repel attacks by
                taking advantage of the area's mountainous terrain. They were particularly skillful in harvesting rainwater,
                agriculture and stone carving. Petra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its famous Al-Khazneh structure –
                believed to be the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV – was constructed, and its population peaked at an
                estimated 20,000 inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Although the Nabataean kingdom became a client state of the Roman Empire in the first century BC, it was only in 106
                AD that it lost its independence. Petra fell to the Romans, who annexed Nabataea and renamed it as Arabia
                Petraea. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many
                structures. In the Byzantine era several Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline, and by
                the early Islamic era it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown to the West until it was
                rediscovered in 1812 by Johann Ludwig Burckhardt.</p>
            <p>Access to the city is through a 1.2-kilometre-long (0.75 mi) gorge called the Siq, which leads directly to the Khazneh.
                Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, Petra is also called the "Rose City" because of the
                colour of the stone from which it is carved. It has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985. UNESCO has
                described Petra as "one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage". In 2007, Al-Khazneh
                was voted one of the New7Wonders of the World. Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist
                attraction. Tourist numbers peaked at 918,000 in 2010, but there followed a temporary slump during the political
                instability generated by the Arab Spring, which affected countries surrounding Jordan. Visitor numbers subsequently
                increased and reached a record-breaking 1.1 million tourists in 2019, marking the first time that the figure rose above
                the 1 million mark. Tourism in the city was crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic as visitor numbers plummeted to zero
                since March 2020. The Jordanian government has authorized excavations in front of the treasury to make use of the site's
                emptiness.</p>

            <h1>Machu Picchu</h1>
            <p>This Incan site near Cuzco, Peru, was “discovered” in 1911 by Hiram Bingham, who believed it was Vilcabamba, a secret
                Incan stronghold used during the 16th-century rebellion against Spanish rule. Although that claim was later
                disproved, the purpose of Machu Picchu has confounded scholars. Bingham believed it was home to the “Virgins of the
                Sun,” women who lived in convents under a vow of chastity. Others think that it was likely a pilgrimage site, while
                some believe it was a royal retreat. (One thing it apparently should not be is the site of a beer commercial. In
                2000 a crane being used for such an ad fell and cracked a monument.) What is known is that Machu Picchu is one of
                the few major pre-Columbian ruins found nearly intact. Despite its relative isolation high in the Andes Mountains,
                it features agricultural terraces, plazas, residential areas, and temples.</p>
            <p>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel, located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru, on a 2,430-metre
                (7,970 ft) mountain ridge. It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba Province above the
                Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometres (50 mi) northwest of Cuzco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through
                the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate.</p>
            <p>For most speakers of English or Spanish, the first 'c' in Picchu is silent. In English, the name is pronounced
            </p>
            <p>Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti
                (1438–1472). Often mistakenly referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most familiar icon of Inca
                civilization. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later at the time of the Spanish
                conquest. Although known locally, it was not known to the Spanish during the colonial period and remained unknown to
                the outside world until American historian Hiram Bingham brought it to international attention in 1911.</p>
            <p>Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are
                the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows. Most of the outlying buildings have been
                reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared. By 1976, 30% of Machu
                Picchu had been restored and restoration continues.</p>
            <p>Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. In
                2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide internet poll.</p>
            <p>Machu Picchu is believed (by Richard L. Burger) to have been built in the 1450s. Construction appears to date
                from two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438–1471) and Túpac Inca Yupanqui (1472–1493).
                There is a consensus among archaeologists that Pachacutec ordered the construction of the royal estate for himself,
                most likely after a successful military campaign. Though Machu Picchu is considered to be a "royal" estate,
                surprisingly, it would not have been passed down in the line of succession. Rather it was used for 80 years before
                being abandoned, seemingly because of the Spanish Conquests in other parts of the Inca Empire. It is possible
                that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in
                the area.</p>

            <h1>Christ the Redeemer</h1>
            <p>Christ the Redeemer, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro. Its origins date to
                just after World War I, when some Brazilians feared a “tide of godlessness.” They proposed a statue, which was
                ultimately designed by Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski. Construction began in 1926 and was
                completed five years later. The resulting monument stands 98 feet (30 meters) tall—not including its base, which is
                about 26 feet (8 meters) high—and its outstretched arms span 92 feet (28 meters). It is the largest Art Deco
                sculpture in the world. Christ the Redeemer is made of reinforced concrete and is covered in approximately six
                million tiles. Somewhat disconcertingly, the statue has often been struck by lightning, and in 2014 the tip of
                Jesus’s right thumb was damaged during a storm.</p>
            <p>Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor) , local
                is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by
                Polish-French sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with
                French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida fashioned the face. Constructed between 1922 and
                1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92
                ft) wide.</p>
            <p>The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is located at the peak of the 700-metre (2,300 ft)
                Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca Forest National Park overlooking the city of Rio de Janeiro. A symbol of
                Christianity across the world, the statue has also become a cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil, and is
                listed as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.</p>
            <p>Vincentian priest Pedro Maria Boss first suggested placing a Christian monument on Mount Corcovado in the mid 1850s
                to honor Princess Isabel, regent of Brazil and the daughter of Emperor Pedro II, but the project was not
                approved. In 1889, the country became a republic, and due to the separation of church and state, the proposed
                statue was dismissed.</p>
            <p>The Catholic Circle[clarification needed] of Rio made a second proposal for a landmark statue on the mountain in
                1920. The group organized an event called Semana do Monumento ("Monument Week") to attract donations and collect
                signatures to support the building of the statue. The organization was motivated by what they perceived as
                'Godlessness' in the society. The donations came mostly from Brazilian Catholics. The designs considered for the
                "Statue of the Christ" included a representation of the Christian cross, a statue of Jesus with a globe in his
                hands, and a pedestal symbolizing the world. The statue of Christ the Redeemer with open arms, a symbol of peace,
                was chosen.</p>
            <p>Local engineer Heitor da Silva Costa designed the statue. French sculptor Paul Landowski created the work.
                In 1922, Landowski commissioned fellow Parisian Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida, who studied sculpture at the
                Fine Arts Conservatory in Bucharest and in Italy.</p>
            <p>A group of engineers and technicians studied Landowski's submissions and felt building the structure of reinforced
                concrete (designed by Albert Caquot) instead of steel was more suitable for the cross-shaped statue. The concrete
                making up the base was supplied from Limhamn, Sweden. The outer layers are soapstone, chosen for its
                enduring qualities and ease of use. Construction took nine years, from 1922 to 1931 and cost the equivalent of
                US$250,000 (equivalent to $3,600,000 in 2019) and the monument opened on October 12, 1931. During the opening
                ceremony, the statue was to be lit by a battery of floodlights turned on remotely by Italian shortwave radio
                inventor Guglielmo Marconi, stationed 9,200 kilometres (5,700 mi) away in Rome but because of bad weather, the
                lights were activated on-site.</p>
            <p>In October 2006, on the 75th anniversary of the statue's completion, Archbishop of Rio, Cardinal Eusebio Oscar
                Scheid, consecrated a chapel, named after Brazil's patron saint—Our Lady of the Apparition, under the statue,
                allowing Catholics to hold baptisms and weddings there.</p>
            <p>Lightning struck the statue during a violent thunderstorm on February 10, 2008, causing some damage to the fingers,
                head and eyebrows. The Rio de Janeiro state government initiated a restoration effort to replace some of the outer
                soapstone layers and repair the lightning rods on the statue. Lightning damaged it again, on January 17, 2014,
                dislodging a finger on the right hand.</p>

            <h1>The Colosseum</h1>
            <p>The Colosseum in Rome was built in the first century by order of the Emperor Vespasian. A feat of engineering, the
                amphitheater measures 620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 meters) and features a complex system of vaults. It was capable of
                holding 50,000 spectators, who watched a variety of events. Perhaps most notable were gladiator fights, though men
                battling animals was also common. In addition, water was sometimes pumped into the Colosseum for mock naval
                engagements. However, the belief that Christians were martyred there—namely, by being thrown to lions—is debated.
                According to some estimates, about 500,000 people died in the Colosseum. Additionally, so many animals were captured
                and then killed there that certain species reportedly became extinct.</p>
            <p>The Colosseum , is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of
                the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum and is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is
                still the largest standing amphitheater in the world today, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor
                Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72 and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81).
                Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96). The three emperors that were patrons of
                the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin:
                Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio  by later classicists and archaeologists
                for its association with their family name.</p>
            <p>The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. The Colosseum
                could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points of its history over the centuries,
                having an average audience of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as
                mock sea battles (for only a short time as the hypogeum was soon filled in with mechanisms to support the other
                activities), animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology. The
                building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as
                housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.</p>
            <p>Although substantially ruined because of earthquakes and stone-robbers (for spolia), the Colosseum is still an
                iconic symbol of Imperial Rome and was listed as one of the New7Wonders of the World. It is one of Rome's most
                popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a
                torchlit "Way of the Cross" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum.</p>
            <p>Originally, the building's Latin name was simply the Latin: amphitheatrum, lit. 'amphitheatre'. Though the modern
                name Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: amphitheatrum Flavium) is often used, there is no evidence it was used in
                Classical Antiquity. This name refers to the patronage of the Flavian dynasty, during whose reigns the building
                was constructed, but the structure is better known as the Colosseum. In antiquity, Romans may have referred to
                the Colosseum by the unofficial name Amphitheatrum Caesareum (with Caesareum an adjective pertaining to the title
                Caesar), but this name may have been strictly poetic as it was not exclusive to the Colosseum; Vespasian and
                Titus, builders of the Colosseum, also constructed an Flavian Amphitheatre in Puteoli (modern Pozzuoli).</p>
            <p>The name colosseum for the amphitheatre is attested from the 6th century, during Late Antiquity. The name
                Colosseum is believed to be derived from a colossal statue of Nero on the model of the Colossus of Rhodes.
                The giant bronze sculpture of Nero as a solar deity was moved to its position beside the amphitheatre by the emperor
                Hadrian (r. 117–138). The word colosseum is a neuter Latin noun formed from the adjective colosseus, meaning
                "gigantic" or "colossean". By the year 1000 the Latin name "Colosseum" had been coined to refer to the
                amphitheatre from the nearby "Colossus Solis".</p>
            <p>The site chosen was a flat area on the floor of a low valley between the Caelian, Esquiline and Palatine Hills,
                through which a canalised stream ran as well as an artificial lake/marsh. By the 2nd century BC the area was
                densely inhabited. It was devastated by the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD, following which Nero seized much of the
                area to add to his personal domain. He built the grandiose Domus Aurea on the site, in front of which he created an
                artificial lake surrounded by pavilions, gardens and porticoes. The existing Aqua Claudia aqueduct was extended to
                supply water to the area and the gigantic bronze Colossus of Nero was set up nearby at the entrance to the Domus
                Aurea.</p>
            <p>Cross-section from the Lexikon der gesamten Technik (1904) Although the Colossus was preserved, much of the Domus Aurea was torn down.
                 The lake was filled in and the land reused as the location for the new Flavian Amphitheatre. Gladiatorial schools and other support buildings were
                constructed nearby within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea. Vespasian's decision to build the Colosseum on the
                site of Nero's lake can be seen as a populist gesture of returning to the people an area of the city which Nero had
                appropriated for his own use. In contrast to many other amphitheatres, which were on the outskirts of a city, the
                Colosseum was constructed in the city centre, in effect, placing it both symbolically and precisely at the heart of
                Rome.</p>

            <h1>Tajmahal</h1>
            <p>This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the world’s most iconic monuments and is perhaps the
                finest example of Mughal architecture. It was built by Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to honor his wife Mumtāz
                Maḥal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child. It took about 22 years and
                20,000 workers to construct the complex, which includes an immense garden with a reflecting pool. The mausoleum is
                made of white marble that features semiprecious stones in geometric and floral patterns. Its majestic central dome
                is surrounded by four smaller domes. According to some reports, Shah Jahān wished to have his own mausoleum made out
                of black marble. However, he was deposed by one of his sons before any work began.</p>
            <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra.
                It was commissioned in 1632 by
                the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it
                also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which
                includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
            <p>Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project
                for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost
                estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about
                U.S. $956 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of
                architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.</p>
            <p>The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and
                one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of
                Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year and in
                2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.</p>
            <p>The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on
                17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum. Construction started in 1632, and
                the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later.
                The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as
                the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.</p>
            <p>The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Indo-Islamic and earlier Mughal architecture. Specific
                inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur,
                progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand), Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and
                hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the Baby Taj), and Shah
                Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah
                Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new
                levels of refinement.</p>
            <p>The tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. It is a large, white marble structure standing
                on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an iwan (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large
                dome and finial. Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Indo-Islamic in origin.</p>
            <p>The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that
                is approximately 55 metres (180 ft) on each of the four long sides. Each side of the iwan is framed with a huge pishtaq
                or vaulted archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. This motif of stacked pishtaqs is
                replicated on the chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical on all sides of the building. Four
                minarets frame the tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The main chamber houses the
                false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level.</p>
